    "* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)\n",
    "  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros\n",
    "  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)\n",

    "* gcc/g++ >= 5.4\n",

    "## Basic Build Instructions\n",

    "1. Clone this repo.\n",
    "2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
    "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`\n",

    "using the following settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* indent using spaces\n",
    "* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)\n"
